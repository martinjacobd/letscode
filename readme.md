Let's Code a Webapp
===
This is the code to a [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM-yypg9gqc&list=PLTQ6txtOr3ca7XrblvjldYsxMSCcvzLry) I am making where we are going to code a bookkeeping webapp in Common Lisp. Start from the first video to get set up with Emacs and SLIME and see where it takes you!
